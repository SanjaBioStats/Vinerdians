# Rules built on science are good. Actions built on science are better. But how do we make science useful at the root (of grape vine)?

# Science writes papers, but papers are not as tasty as good wine. How can we make science as tasty as wine?


# Whats the problem?

Science produces papers like clockwork. Researchers pour in time, brains, and passion — yet out in the real world, people often roll their eyes at the new rules and regulations that result.

But what happens if we turn the logic around? Instead of waiting for science to justify rules after the fact, what if we use scientific tools from the very beginning to guide our actions?

Could science help us move faster, smarter, greener — instead of making every step feel like the road is only getting thornier?


# Whats (maybe) a solution?

This is not (yet) a farm, it’s a small thought experiment with a keyboard and an idea.

The idea: imagine how agriculture could look if science wasn’t just a bystander, but the main tool from the start.

This repository contains the try to use science not as a stamp of approval at the end, but as a compass at the beginning. 
Which datasets, methods, and models can help us make decisions that are grounded instead of guessed?

To keep it fair, I only use open-source data — the kind anyone can access. That way, the experiment stays transparent, reproducible, and maybe even useful beyond this one vineyard dream. 

Rather than a blueprint, this is a test run that started from a simple curiosity: I’m a scientist with an interest in agriculture, and I want to test how easily scientific insights can actually be used in real life conditions.


# Whats in this repository?

This repository is the playground for the experiment. Instead of vines and tractors, it starts with files and folders.

/data/ → Open datasets used in the scripts

/Overview/ → Readme file with an overview of the progress and subfolders for output (generated plots, tables, stuff like this)

/Scripts/ → R Scripts used for evaluation of Data, for each analysis there is a subfolder with a readme file and the script 




# Let's see how far we get.
