In this script I roughly analyzed open source data from the Copernicus CORINE data (2018) to get a brief overview about Vineyards in Europe.

It´s the starting point of every analysis: Which tree do I need to climb to get a good overview of all the data that needs to be analysed?

Starting with a Map of the World, then focusing on Vineyards in Europe (with a Map and a more descriptive Bar Plot), and to narrow it further down: focussing on Germany (Country that is listed in the middle of our Vineyards in Ha per Country Plot: less competitors, but still good infrastructure.)

After this quick overview analysis, a second script will be uploaded - Analyzing climate conditions in Regions with Vineyards. So stay tuned!

(For further information about the code, have a look in the script. Nearly every step is commented.)
